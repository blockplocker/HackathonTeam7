The car worked for a few days but then the problem reappeared. The technician intervened again without being able to witness any anomaly. As a preventive measure, the thermostat was replaced and further tests were carried out in heavy operation. No anomalies detected.

We kindly ask for support for evaluation.

While installing i was checking and replacing all seals and found that on the banjo fitting on the primary filter banjo bolt that it looked like a preesure regulating bolt instead of  a plain banjo bolt. When i look up in prosis page  235/300 part 27 part number 991046 is a hollow bolt.  And that in the return line at tank part  22 part number 3594288 valve for t he banjo bolt, while the one installed on machine was a reguler banjo bolt.

Thank you for letting us know where the issue was. Great that you could identify the damaged hose and that the issue seems to be resolved by that finding. The hose, I suspect you mentioned, can be found in FG561/210.






































It was a bit tricky to find it here, but I could understand why this air hose/plastic pipe is under the compressed-air brake FG. I set this case as a proposed solution for you to close it if no further support is needed.

From historical errors, the technician verified error code P111E00 even if during the tests the temperature never rose from the middle level. 
Checks are carried out on connections and wiring of the motor temperature sensor. Replaced temperature sensor. (21531072)
The car worked for a few days but then the problem reappeared. The technician intervened again without being able to witness any anomaly. As a preventive measure, the thermostat was replaced and further tests were carried out in heavy operation. No anomalies detected.

We kindly ask for support for evaluation.

Thanks, greetings

",null,waste water treatment plant,"Hello Gary, Good to hear the machine is now without faults. Well done! Thank you for keeping the case going, I think this is a team work on which all of us have learned from it, I am sure. I agree that PROSIS needs to be updated with the correct information and add any note that may be necessary on the measurements control procedure about the CAN-busses when an additional option is part of circuit to make a diagnostic correctly and efficiently. On the CAN-bus 6 I guess that only the HMIM has a terminating resistor on pins 35 and 36 and physically R3614 on the circuit, and no terminating resistor on the SID nor in the W-ECU and that should also be described in PROSIS, IMHO. I encourage you to make a PROSIS feedback explaining in detail your suggestion about what information is in PROSIS that could improve your fault tracing and troubleshooting. If no more support is needed, I set this case as a proposed solution for you to act accordingly.

The car worked for a few days but then the problem reappeared. The technician intervened again without being able to witness any anomaly. As a preventive measure, the thermostat was replaced and further tests were carried out in heavy operation. No anomalies detected.

We kindly ask for support for evaluation.

When i look up in prosis page  235/300 part 27 part number 991046 is a hollow bolt.  And that in the return line at tank part  22 part number 3594288 valve for t he banjo bolt, while the one installed on machine was a reguler banjo bolt. I have  gotten the correct part number  from parts and it is too small for the threads in the tank. Can you let me know",null,muddy,"Tony if this machine is running lower the urgency and monitor or complete the cause and correctio0n field then accept the proposed solution, Thanks Mike",null,Fuel aeration,null,null,Closed,VOE22035823,235 Fuel lines,89c0080687ee4110eb664116cebb3516,FG2: Contamination / Blocked / Clogged,Fuel; Oil; Water; plungers; Filters; etc.,Grading,"[""P800A00""]"

I was unable to perform regen because of this. I replaced tempsensor after DPF (se2543) which solved the P242A85 DTC and the regen passed.
However the machine triggers P203164 almost every morning still.
We have replaced tempsensor before DOC (SE2521) and before DPF (SE2522) which has not resolved the problem. 
According to Prosis it is possible for the ambient air tempsensor and the engine coolant tampsensor to mess with SE2522 and trigger P203164. I have compare the temp which the ambient air tempsensor reads with an IR thermometer and it seems to work fine. However this was when the DTC was inactive so it can still be a faulty air temp sensor but the operator believes that the air tempsensor reads relatively correct values when operating the machine.
My question is: Is there any documented cases of a faulty wiringharnes or leaking injector causing this DTC?
I couldn't find any on this platform but maybe there is anyway?

Thank you for keeping the case going, I think this is a team work on which all of us have learned from it, I am sure. I agree that PROSIS needs to be updated with the correct information and add any note that may be necessary on the measurements control procedure about the CAN-busses when an additional option is part of circuit to make a diagnostic correctly and efficiently. On the CAN-bus 6 I guess that only the HMIM has a terminating resistor on pins 35 and 36 and physically R3614 on the circuit, and no terminating resistor on the SID nor in the W-ECU and that should also be described in PROSIS, IMHO. I encourage you to make a PROSIS feedback explaining in detail your suggestion about what information is in PROSIS that could improve your fault tracing and troubleshooting.

This morning my colleague tested this tank unit and with normal AdBlue in a container it shows immediately 33% after moving the level sensor upwards.
But if you pour special Adblue Air1 Optispray in a container and put the quality sensor in it, move the level sensor upwards, immediately the quality sensor shows 63%.

He replaced the EGR sensor and the temperature dropped to 150 degree celcius. He tried a new E-ECU but this didn't change the situation. After pulling and pushing on the engine cable harness the EGR temperature dropped suddenly to 20 degree celcius. Machine ran well for a few days and suddenly the same problem appearred again. At the second visit the mechanic didn't a error code read out again and found the next error codes: P040a64 1x P112100 23x P112198 26x P112200 82x P112298 77x P245700 2x Again EGR temperature was 200 degree celcius. New sensor showed 168 degree celcius. This time after pulling on the cable harness between engine and E-ECU and ACM ECU the temperature dropped again. So we replaced the cable harness between engine and ECU's and that solved the problem.

Mechanic did the usual checks and didn't find the active fault code.  All Techtool test regarding the AdBlue system were completed without any fault. We performed the AdBlue dosing test and the amount of AdBlue was not high enough. We replaced the AdBlue nozzle and after that the amount of AdBlue was according to the specs. However the fault code is pointing to the air pressure. We also noticed that the pump pressure was fluctuating very much and that the pump duty cycle was too high. We checked if the compressor air system was cutting in and out and that seems to be alright. Also compressed air tank is full. So we concluded that the problem must be in the AdBlue pump unit, so we replaced that AdBlue pump this solved the fluctuation of the pump pressure and everything seems to be solved.

However on 18-2-2023 the same error code appeared again.
So we  concluded that there must something wrong whit the compressed air system, so w",null,null,Thank you for the information.Replace air compressor Adblue nozzle and Adblue pump unit.,null,Air compressor internal leakage.,null,null,Closed,VOE22040500,254 Catalytic converter; exhaust emission control equipment,c16292d587ea4d10018d63573cbb3521,FG2: Internal Leakage,Internal leakage / transfers - Engine with associated parts and components.,"Aggregates, Sand, Gravel","[""P20CA00""]"
